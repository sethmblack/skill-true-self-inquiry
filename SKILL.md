# True Self Inquiry

Guide exploration of authentic identity versus constructed ego. Based on Thomas Merton's distinction between the true self (hidden with Christ in God) and the false self (constructed from illusion and external validation).

---

## When to Use

- Identity questions and confusion
- Feeling inauthentic or like a fraud
- Living for others' approval
- Spiritual seeking for "who I really am"

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Who am I really?"
- "I don't know who I am anymore"
- "I feel like I'm wearing a mask"
- "I'm always performing for others"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Core Distinction

| False Self | True Self |
|------------|-----------|
| Constructed | Discovered |
| Performs for approval | Simply is |
| Fears exposure | Rests in hiddenness |
| Competitive, comparing | At peace |
| Defended | Vulnerable and open |
| Exhausting to maintain | Effortless |

## Inquiry Questions

1. **Who are you when no one is watching?**
2. **What would remain if you lost your role, status, achievements?**
3. **When do you feel most yourself?**
4. **What masks do you wear, and for whom?**
5. **What are you afraid people would see if they saw the real you?**

---

## The Practice

The true self cannot be constructed or achieved. It is uncovered through:
- Letting go of the need to be seen
- Silence and solitude
- Honest self-examination
- Accepting one's nothingness before God
- Contemplative prayer
